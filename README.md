# getting-clojure

Description:
This work is an effort to provide a walkthrough style guide to
Russ Olsen's book "Getting Clojure". It is the best I've found to
learn the language, and I enjoy how demonstratable it is. Nearly
all of the code I use here is present in the book, so all attributes
go to Russ Olsen.

User Guide:
Generally, a user of this walkthrough will be able to execute
each line of code via a CIDER repl line-by-line (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-E).
The goal is for users to understand what each line does, or learn
what it does by executing it.
